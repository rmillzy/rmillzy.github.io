> This theme is designed by Xiaoying Riley at [3rd Wave Media](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/).
> Visit [her website](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/) for more themes. [Sharath Kumar](https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv) converted this to a Jekyll theme which made it usable for Github pages. I have further edited this theme to suit my needs.
