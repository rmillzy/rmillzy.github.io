    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        As an Economist with eight years in the dairy sector, I apply advanced econometric skills to address environmental and economic challenges. My expertise in data analysis and modeling translates complex datasets into actionable insights for stakeholders ranging from farmers to government bodies. Proficient in R, Matlab, Julia, Python, Java, and C++, I develop models and data visualizations that inform strategic decisions for the dairy sector. I quickly master new programming tools, tackling both micro- and macroeconometric challenges. Experience with project management and strategic thinking to focus on improving sustainability while enhancing economic viability of the dairy industry.
