          Quantitative and Qualitative focused role delivering economic insights to farmers and the industry body. Key contributor to several pieces of work including:
            - The Economic Farm Survey (2018/19, 2019/20)
            - Regional forecasting for dairy farm financials for owner operating and share milking farm businesses
            - The DSP model - A biophysical and economic model assessing the impacts of regulation, prices and adoption of technologies and environmental mitigations.
            - Dairy herd population simulation - A non-normal multivariate (over 140 variables) represenative simulation of New Zealands 10,600 dairy herds.
        Current focuses are on the financial competitiveness of pastoral land uses in New Zealand, generating representative distributions around the regional forecasts, project management, and mentoring junior colleagues in programming and dairy economics.

            - Asymptotic efficiency in forecast averaging methods
            - Nowcasting averaging methods
            - Mortaility and economic activity
            - Time-varying hedonic house pricing

            - Used optimality conditions to determine convergence to a local minima and multi-start searches build evidence of a global minima
            - Used several derivative and non-derivative methods to further test robustness of the solution
